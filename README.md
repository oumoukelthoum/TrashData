# TrashData 🗑️

TrashData is a dataset for waste classification, organized into three categories: Organic (O) 🍃, Recyclable (R) ♻️, and Toxic (T) ☠️. This dataset is intended to support machine learning models for waste sorting and environmental sustainability projects.

## Dataset Overview 📊

The dataset contains a total of 70,859 images distributed across three categories. Below is a table summarizing the number of images in each category:

| Category      | Number of Images |
|---------------|------------------|
| Organic (O) 🍃 | 16,314           |
| Recyclable (R) ♻️ | 51,228         |
| Toxic (T) ☠️ | 3,317            |

## Directory Structure 📁

The dataset is organized into the following directory structure:

```
TrashData/
├── O  🍃
├── R  ♻️
└── T  ☠️
```
